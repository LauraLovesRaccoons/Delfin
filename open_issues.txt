# ah yes

- There is no storage space limiter implemented

- Signature is slightly boken in outlook web under WebKit browsers.
    -> Suspect: Outlook probably has a default "hidden" stylesheet

- pdf combiner doesn't have a limiter
    -> out of memory errors (and out of storage) are possible

- there is no protection against a .docx document containing a zip bomb
    -> out of memory and out of storage errors possible

- manipulated .docx documents can cause the pdf file to become really really large
    -> out of memory, out of storage, mails failing to send, pdf combiner failing

- the Users table has a login id that is unused
    -> dual login possible; due to job lock flag, no crashes are possible

- job lock flag doesn't clear on full container restart if it has been set
    -> usually related to crashes

- the uploads and logs folders aren't protected against CRUD
    -> tons of crashes possible

- composer needs to be installed on the host machine
    -> should be part of the dockerfile, though I struggle with that part
