Version 1.1.1

1) Fixed entered special symbols like & being stored html encoded inside the db
    -> & would turn to &amp;
        -> and since that is a valid string you can imagine what happened...
2) Finally changed the version number in readme.md
3) 1.1.1 cool number ðŸ¦†

Version 1.1.0

1) Upgraded php apache from 8.2 to 8.4
2) max-upload env in compose.yaml has whitespaces removed "( = ) (=)" to support newer versions of docker
    -> refresh_env.bat for example wouldn't run without the fix
3) force upgraded phpmailer from version 6.9.X to 6.10.X
4) properly re-installed the container (took a while) and did re-install the composer vendor packages and tested it
    -> and everything seemed to work seamlessly
5) since php apache was upgraded to a much newer build, I shall name this version 1.1.0

Version 1.0.2

1) If both nom & nom2 are empty it will default the recipient's name to their email address
    -> we don't care about the part if no email is present since in that case no email will be sent either way

---

Version 1.0.1

1) if nom&nom2 are empty it will still send an email but the logger has a better "warning message"
    -> functions.php

2) Updated README.md
    -> now isn't a jumbled mess of old non updated commands
    -> also it now has headers

3) (renamed the folders batch files and setup db query)
    -> (allows cleaner readme file)
