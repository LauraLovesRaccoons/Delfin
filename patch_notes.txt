Version 1.5.2

1) added a guide to the readme.md on how you should handle crashes that happened during an active job
2) Job_Lock.sql was updated to drop the table if it exists to provide an easy solution to handle the previous line

---

Version 1.5.1

1) added the database name to the .env example file since the setup database querys specifically target that name

---

Version 1.5.0

1) tweaked the dockerfile to supress php warnings for users (uploads above 20MB)
2) removed a typo in a path from the dockerfile
3) uploads above 20MB are now handled properly
    -> you just get redirected to a new error /warning page (with stylesheet)
4) 2 "major" releases in a single day
    -> WOLOLO 
        -> the colour blue is now red
5) be sure to use the shutdown batch file and then run the first run batch file

---

Version 1.4.0

1) dropped nisam's package and wrote a custom function (with a lot of inspiration from the original code)
    -> I mean the package could just disappear in the future and then we're screwed basically (when we replace the machine)
2) composer now targets the working versions (and latest at the time of writting) of the packages as the minimum version
    -> able to backtrack IF an update breaks something

---

Version 1.3.0

1) the loading screen when processessing your files no adds further measures to disable accidentaly clicking something
2) the loading screen should now always be fullscreen, also lighter css code
3) the email info box for those that don't have a (valid) email or those whose email failed to send somehow, finally doesn't load the wrapper div in letter mode
    -> and if email mode processes everything it will also not display, was almost not included in this release

---

Version 1.2.3.4.5

1) change the send mail and prepare letters buttons to require a double click
    -> handled by javascript
        -> since this bypasses the default html form submission the loading screen animation had to have its logic changed a tiny bit
2) the loading screen now has non selectable text and the cursor changes to a loading icon as well
3) since this is a bit major (I work at a municipality so the mayor is proud (probably... he's busy)) there now is a fourth and fifth number
    -> also 1.2.3.4.5 is done on purpose :startrekkin:
4) Now versions are structed like this V.W.X.Y.Z
    -> V - almost never changes unless there is like an extremely massive overhaul
    -> W - never feature is added or major bug fix
    -> X - bug fixes or optimisations
    -> Y - small changes mostly irrelevant (you can mostly ignore those releases) - also this number might not always show up
    -> Z - very minor changes and code/comment cleanup (very irrelevant) - also this number will rarely show up
5) Next version will be V 1.3.0 - even if an old comment is cleaned up

---

Version 1.2.3

1) composer removed a lot of unused packages
2) functions.php removed a package from something that wasn't used in any way
3) Version 1.2.3 such a cool number ðŸ¦†

---

Version 1.2.2

1) the company division message in index.php is now loaded from the .env file
    -> allows others to use the same code and personalize the page somewhat

---

Version 1.2.1

1) the job lock clear function now also targets the id as well
    -> meaning multiple processes can use this db table
        -> also everything else related to it already specified the id

---

Version 1.2.0

1) in email mode (only) you can now add any file as an attachement (totally optional)
    -> for people that don't have an email well since you uploaded the attachement you should be able to print it yourself since you uploaded it
        -> also the attachements aren't added to the letters itself since that might result in weird stuff (formatting)
2) didn't forget to change the version number in readme.md
3) 1.2.0 cool number ðŸ¦† roll
4) this video gave me a lot of inspiration for this project
    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHg5SJYRHA0
5) I'm the best coder in this project (I'm also the only one duh)

---

Version 1.1.1

1) Fixed entered special symbols like & being stored html encoded inside the db
    -> & would turn to &amp;
        -> and since that is a valid string you can imagine what happened...
2) Finally changed the version number in readme.md
3) 1.1.1 cool number ðŸ¦†

---

Version 1.1.0

1) Upgraded php apache from 8.2 to 8.4
2) max-upload env in compose.yaml has whitespaces removed "( = ) (=)" to support newer versions of docker
    -> refresh_env.bat for example wouldn't run without the fix
3) force upgraded phpmailer from version 6.9.X to 6.10.X
4) properly re-installed the container (took a while) and did re-install the composer vendor packages and tested it
    -> and everything seemed to work seamlessly
5) since php apache was upgraded to a much newer build, I shall name this version 1.1.0

---

Version 1.0.2

1) If both nom & nom2 are empty it will default the recipient's name to their email address
    -> we don't care about the part if no email is present since in that case no email will be sent either way

---

Version 1.0.1

1) if nom&nom2 are empty it will still send an email but the logger has a better "warning message"
    -> functions.php

2) Updated README.md
    -> now isn't a jumbled mess of old non updated commands
    -> also it now has headers

3) (renamed the folders batch files and setup db query)
    -> (allows cleaner readme file)

---

Version 1.0.0

The entire project
