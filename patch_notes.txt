Version 1.0.2

1) If both nom & nom2 are empty it will default the recipient's name to their email address
    -> we don't care about the part if no email is present since in that case no email will be sent either way

---

Version 1.0.1

1) if nom&nom2 are empty it will still send an email but the logger has a better "warning message"
    -> functions.php

2) Updated README.md
    -> now isn't a jumbled mess of old non updated commands
    -> also it now has headers

3) (renamed the folders batch files and setup db query)
    -> (allows cleaner readme file)
