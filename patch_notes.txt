Version 1.6.7

1) send_mail.php : if the target directory or target user array is somehow cleared from the session
    -> the job lock flag will become unlocked, allowing other users to process batch jobs instead of being stuck in an infinite loop
2) httpd.conf - better comment
3) the dummy user array now also uses the trim function to unify the code a bit
4) obvious invalid emails will not run through the in comparison slow rfc email validator (performance hit before that part is negligible)
    -> since letter mode or letter required db entry turns the email into an empty string; the code will process much faster, since these emails will be aborted before the rfc validator

---


Version 1.6.6.6

1) made every header("Location: ") use double quotes instead of single quotes
    -> double quotes allow better flexability with variables
2) also found a stray non root redirect to the landing page
3) added an additional line to the collision page that there is a small chance that the cmos battery (for the rtc) is failing
    -> since in that case timestamp collisions are much more likely

---

Version 1.6.6

1) the template for the signature now redirect to the server's root delfin.php (landing page)
    -> and added clearer comments on why it redirects you even if you have a proper session, if you visit it manually

---

Version 1.6.5

1) the letters that are provided as a downloadable pdf now have a more standout name and it feels more machine generated
    -> yes that WAS the only remaining luxembourgish line

---

Version 1.6.4

1) removed a double encoding of the recipient's name for the case that both nom & nom2 are empty in which case the email is used instead
    -> I decode the recipient's email and name only once (for reference)
2) better comments (and removed old ones) from send_mail.php and in functions.php
3) added a comment why  use PHPMailer\PHPMailer\SMTP;  is marked as not used
    ->  it's for a php mailer debugging purpose that is commented out
        -> no performance hit since the code isn't called

---

Version 1.6.3

1) clearer comments
2) the edit tiny integer ajax now forces the console.log to use a string instead of being empty
    -> also it now writes to the log if someone toggles a tinyint instead of just the moment the javascript file is being loaded
        -> and it now has a message

---

Version 1.6.2

1) The email validator now uses egulias's rfc email validator package to be able to send to rfc compliant emails

---

Version 1.6.1

1) the mail error handler now uses the $e variable (allows you to use part of this code for pre- php:8.0 projects)
    -> $e variable was previously assigned but went unused
2) the shell command outputs now have a clearer variable
    -> $outputShellCommand variable is unused but can be uncommented for console output (debugging reasons)
        -> $outputShellCommand is also the only variable,parameter,global that remains unused (unless you uncomment it ;)
3) the mail send function now decodes the receiver's email and name before sending, since those have been previously encoded
    -> though the receiver usually doesn't see these lines and it's mostly for replies from mail could not be delivered
4) the email is now validated by php's internal email validate function
5) general code improvements in functions.php

---

Version 1.6.0

1) Nom Coupon Réponse now uses the real field name

---

Version 1.5.10

1) the name of the CID images are now dynamically adjusted
    -> you still have to manually declare the mime type but at least you can do it at the top of functions.php
2) cleaned up the code a teeny tiny bit
3) the Accounts.sql table now adds a sessionId entry for future use

---

Version 1.5.9

1) the login script now has a session fixation prevention
2) If someone with the exact same id manages to be logged in twice and they manage to upload a file at the exact same second, 
    -> the slowest one will be redirected to collision.php
3) created and "designed" collision.php
4) each redirect to delfin.php and upload_too_large.php now targets the root
5) The collision prevention also kicks in if the filenames aren't an exact match and the uploader targeted users with different ids
    -> just someone with the same id trying to upload a file at the exact same second triggers the collision prevention
        -> the attachement folder's file could be overwriten by another file with the exact same name before, so this is now fixed as well

---

Version 1.5.8

1) the session+cookie and index.php now properly handle a buggy .env file

---

Version 1.5.7

1) the cookie's name now also respects the container's name

---

Version 1.5.6

1) if the .env file is porperly configured
    -> each container will be truly independant from each other
        -> even the docker network

---

Version 1.5.5

1) header and footer are now php files instead of html files
    -> VSCode's find and replace all helped a lot
2) the app name is now handled dynamically over the .env file
3) the ports are now adjustable in the .env file to allow multiple of these docker containers to run simutaniously
    -> also updated the .env example file
4) there are now default database logins provided in the .env file
    -> since the database doesn't expose a port I can kinda provide example credentials
5) commented out the test cron job for the database backup

---

Version 1.5.4

1) added ERROR 404 redirect
2) every target Location (redirect to) index;logout;.php are now using the root of the webserver as a base
3) Capitalised every header('location: ...') to header('Location: ...')
4) removed all the old custom error pages
5) keept the index.html just in case someone doesn't realise that this is a php server

---

Version 1.5.3

1) code performance improvements & better readability
2) quirks layout in the easteregg page fixed
3) removed luxembourgish from login.php (everything) and functions.php (database status)
4) applied a bit of uniform design if the database has an issue
5) login.php provides a nice error box and it's less likely that the database has an issue after successfully login in (since it connects to the same database)

---

Version 1.5.2

1) added a guide to the readme.md on how you should handle crashes that happened during an active job
2) Job_Lock.sql was updated to drop the table if it exists to provide an easy solution to handle the previous line

---

Version 1.5.1

1) added the database name to the .env example file since the setup database querys specifically target that name

---

Version 1.5.0

1) tweaked the dockerfile to supress php warnings for users (uploads above 20MB)
2) removed a typo in a path from the dockerfile
3) uploads above 20MB are now handled properly
    -> you just get redirected to a new error /warning page (with stylesheet)
4) 2 "major" releases in a single day
    -> WOLOLO 
        -> the colour blue is now red
5) be sure to use the shutdown batch file and then run the first run batch file

---

Version 1.4.0

1) dropped nisam's package and wrote a custom function (with a lot of inspiration from the original code)
    -> I mean the package could just disappear in the future and then we're screwed basically (when we replace the machine)
2) composer now targets the working versions (and latest at the time of writting) of the packages as the minimum version
    -> able to backtrack IF an update breaks something

---

Version 1.3.0

1) the loading screen when processessing your files no adds further measures to disable accidentaly clicking something
2) the loading screen should now always be fullscreen, also lighter css code
3) the email info box for those that don't have a (valid) email or those whose email failed to send somehow, finally doesn't load the wrapper div in letter mode
    -> and if email mode processes everything it will also not display, was almost not included in this release

---

Version 1.2.3.4.5

1) change the send mail and prepare letters buttons to require a double click
    -> handled by javascript
        -> since this bypasses the default html form submission the loading screen animation had to have its logic changed a tiny bit
2) the loading screen now has non selectable text and the cursor changes to a loading icon as well
3) since this is a bit major (I work at a municipality so the mayor is proud (probably... he's busy)) there now is a fourth and fifth number
    -> also 1.2.3.4.5 is done on purpose :startrekkin:
4) Now versions are structed like this V.W.X.Y.Z
    -> V - almost never changes unless there is like an extremely massive overhaul
    -> W - never feature is added or major bug fix
    -> X - bug fixes or optimisations
    -> Y - small changes mostly irrelevant (you can mostly ignore those releases) - also this number might not always show up
    -> Z - very minor changes and code/comment cleanup (very irrelevant) - also this number will rarely show up
5) Next version will be V 1.3.0 - even if an old comment is cleaned up

---

Version 1.2.3

1) composer removed a lot of unused packages
2) functions.php removed a package from something that wasn't used in any way
3) Version 1.2.3 such a cool number 🦆

---

Version 1.2.2

1) the company division message in index.php is now loaded from the .env file
    -> allows others to use the same code and personalize the page somewhat

---

Version 1.2.1

1) the job lock clear function now also targets the id as well
    -> meaning multiple processes can use this db table
        -> also everything else related to it already specified the id

---

Version 1.2.0

1) in email mode (only) you can now add any file as an attachement (totally optional)
    -> for people that don't have an email well since you uploaded the attachement you should be able to print it yourself since you uploaded it
        -> also the attachements aren't added to the letters itself since that might result in weird stuff (formatting)
2) didn't forget to change the version number in readme.md
3) 1.2.0 cool number 🦆 roll
4) this video gave me a lot of inspiration for this project
    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHg5SJYRHA0
5) I'm the best coder in this project (I'm also the only one duh)

---

Version 1.1.1

1) Fixed entered special symbols like & being stored html encoded inside the db
    -> & would turn to &amp;
        -> and since that is a valid string you can imagine what happened...
2) Finally changed the version number in readme.md
3) 1.1.1 cool number 🦆

---

Version 1.1.0

1) Upgraded php apache from 8.2 to 8.4
2) max-upload env in compose.yaml has whitespaces removed "( = ) (=)" to support newer versions of docker
    -> refresh_env.bat for example wouldn't run without the fix
3) force upgraded phpmailer from version 6.9.X to 6.10.X
4) properly re-installed the container (took a while) and did re-install the composer vendor packages and tested it
    -> and everything seemed to work seamlessly
5) since php apache was upgraded to a much newer build, I shall name this version 1.1.0

---

Version 1.0.2

1) If both nom & nom2 are empty it will default the recipient's name to their email address
    -> we don't care about the part if no email is present since in that case no email will be sent either way

---

Version 1.0.1

1) if nom&nom2 are empty it will still send an email but the logger has a better "warning message"
    -> functions.php

2) Updated README.md
    -> now isn't a jumbled mess of old non updated commands
    -> also it now has headers

3) (renamed the folders batch files and setup db query)
    -> (allows cleaner readme file)

---

Version 1.0.0

The entire project
