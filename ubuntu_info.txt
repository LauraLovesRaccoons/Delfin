Ubuntu 24.04 LTS

you might wanna install openssh (you should know how to do that)

download Docker from Canonical from the Ubuntu "App Store"

install composer
https://getcomposer.org/download/
there are some terminal commands on that page that you need to install it properly
...
and after that you need to run this (allows you to run composer from anywhere)
    sudo mv composer.phar /usr/local/bin/composer


set up your .env file correctly
change ports if necessary

as the docker commands don't have sudo rights by default you might wanna use sudo for now

(you have to be in the root of the project folder)
- sudo composer install
- sudo docker compose --profile pma up -d --build
    (phpmyadmin is enabled to allow you to manage the database)
-- restart your machine to ensure it auto starts
-- phpmyadmin stuff
- sudo docker compose --profile pma up -d
- sudo docker compose stop phpmyadmin

    (to stop the entire container)
- sudo docker compose --profile pma stop

    (to refresh the .env file)
- sudo docker compose --profile pma down
- docker compose up -d

â€¦

Important:
AFTER building the project for the first time
You need to terminal move into the root directory of the project (usually /Delfin/) {case sensitive!}
in that folder run
- sudo chmod 777 logs
- sudo chmod 777 uploads
if you don't, after uploading a file, you will be send straight back to the landing page with no error message

and of course set up the database tables in phpmyadmin!!!
    /batch_files/setup_db_query/

    -> also README.md might contain additional information
